Flask web Scraper

I stumbled across a paywall-protected article that I wanted to read and noticed that it was not effortless.
The usual tools could not capture the text.
However, I noticed that the paywall was activated after about a second after landing on the page.
I then thought that a scraper could capture the text.
I tried a quick and dirt solution and it actually worked!
Solved the specific problem, just for fun I created this web-app in flask to make the solution scalable and disposable, either for sites with paywall or simply to capture H1,H2,H3 and P from any site.
For now it's not very optimised, it was a project built really on the fly.

Of course this is done just for training and study purpose. 

I do not intend to incite or promote the use of protected content in any way.
Implementation and use is at your own risk
